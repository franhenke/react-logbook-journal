    entry:
      'The crowing point of County Donegal’s Fanad Peninsula is a lighthouse dating back to 1817; it was built in response to the sinking of a warship in Lough Swilly, in which the sole survivor was a parrot. Still a functioning lighthouse, it’s one of 12 that make up the Great Lighthouses of Ireland – a new initiative allowing visitors the chance to visit or stay in an Irish lighthouse.',

    title: '50 Shades of Green',
    entry:
      'The Wild Atlantic Way tourist trail doesn’t get much wilder than County Kerry. And while driving the Ring of Kerry route could be considered a form of adventure travel in itself (it’s notoriously narrow in places), hiking the area is considerably more rewarding – especially if you’re able to ascend Ireland’s highest mountain, Carrauntoohil, along the way. Although caution is advised when tackling this climb, if you do manage to reach its peak, you’ll be rewarded with some of the most dramatic scenery in the entire country. If Kerry is a little too off the beaten track, or you’d rather try one of the world’s fastest-growing water sports instead, Mallow in County Cork is home to Ballyhass Wake Park, Ireland’s largest cable wakeboarding facility. It accommodates both beginners and experienced wakeboarders.',
